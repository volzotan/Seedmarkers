8	8	6	6	5		3	4	4	4	7		3	5	4	5	7		Yes	26-35	Female	
3	7	5	6	6	Yes, there probably is.	5	8	4	3	6	I guess.	4	6	3	2	5	Maybe?	Yes	26-35	Male	No
10	7	5	8	4	Uniform colored shapes with hard edges on a different color are very noticable. For me round or curved shapes are much less obtrusive. In case of square colored shapes, the color reduces the obtrusiveness. 	2	7	6	3	8	The aesthetics of a marker on surface/device depends much on the surface/device, but also here round or curved are more aesthetic for me. Round more then curved is guess. 	2	5	6	2	7	also here, round before square. Colors can increase my acceptance, because it can reduce the hard edges inside the marker, but this depends on the size of the marker and my own point of view and distance to the marker.. and of course of the device it self 	Yes	26-35	Male	
4	3	6	3	7	While the darker filled markers made me notice them sooner but it did not have a negative effect.	3	6	7	1	8	Circular markers appealed to more than other shapes. It felt more natural to be present. 	5	5	4	2	8	The marker with dots seems to occupy more space than needed and doesn't fit well on the objects on a regular basis. 	No	26-35	Male

10	6	8	5	10	Yes, difference in levels of distraction	1	1	2	9	9	contrast combination and a sense of "too much going on"	3	1	3	5	4	the level of distraction and "jelling" with the environment 	Yes	26-35	Male	
8	7	7	5	6	Matrix are more related to mobile interaction, web link for example. While others could be brand label which common and I usually ignore them.	6	4	5	9	6		4	3	3	6	5	personal preferences	No	36-45	Female	
5	10	3	1	3	Less colors and objects. 	1	1	2	6	4	Except the point marker, the other markers are too ugly, especially the matrix and color markers. 	1	1	5	7	5		Yes	26-35	Male	I don't know if it is possible, but markers with curved lines would look better than the squares. Maybe you try to achieve it with the circle marker, but it does not feel nice. 
6	9	4	3	3	The QR-Code catches the attention because it is a learned pattern. The Color one is even more obvious.	7	2	5	2	8		5	1	6	3	7		Yes	26-35	Male

5	9	7	4	4	Color and special shape	6	6	8	5	6	Personal preferences	5	6	8	4	4	Appearance - I find it interesting to look at the symbol vs. I don't	No	26-35	Female	
7	6	5	2	4	The Point seemed to belong to the given objets. Perhaps because it is so symmetric. The Matrix (without color) seemed to stick out quite a lot, maybe because we are primed to look for these symbols and because harsh black and white is a stronger contrast to surroundings than color.	3	2	1	4	7	Organic seems very out of place and doesnt fit. The circle actually looks like a nice Logo	7	2	2	7	8		Yes	26-35	Female	
7	9	6	2	5	Point symbol is easy to overlook, colourful poxel stick out on nearly every background	8	9	5	3	5		8	9	6	1	4		No	26-35	Female

10	10	10	10	1	Circle is more related to a Logo so it's more acceptable for the eye.  Also it doesnt contain to much detail inside so it's not instrusive 	1	1	1	1	8		4	1	1	1	9		Yes	18-25	Male	
6	8	7	4	5		5	1	6	3	3		5	1	6	2	3		Yes	18-25	Female	
8	4	5	2	7	The Point Symbol has less elements in it than the other symbols, therefore it does not stand out that much	2	9	4	7	3	I prefer Color over black-and-white images. Also, less clutter makes it more aesthetic as in Symbol Point	3	8	4	7	3	Symbols that are less obtrusive and more aesthetically pleasing result in a higher acceptance	No	18-25	Male	
9	9	4	4	6	Because of the style and color 	9	9	4	4	5	Based on my eye, some colors and design were more appealing   	9	9	2	4	2	because of its uniqueness 	No	18-25	Male	
6	10	6	5	5	no	4	4	4	5	4	everything is looking different	7	4	5	5	8	no 	No	18-25	Female	
6	2	4	1	7	I think it has to do with contrast, so the relation of black and white space. Black and white also sticks out more than the ones with the colors because it has less contrast. 	2	2	2	3	4		1	1	1	6	3	Even though the ones with more contrast are more recognizable, they don't blend in so I wouldn't want them in my room. 	No	18-25	Female	
8	8	8	3	6	Bright color caught my attention sooner. The more dense the pattern, the more obtrusive for me.	5	8	5	3	7	Color seems more pleasant	5	8	7	3	7		Yes	26-35	Male
